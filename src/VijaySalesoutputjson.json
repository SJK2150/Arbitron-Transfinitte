    "Long -term/ short -term bank facilities  100.00  CARE A+; Stable/CARE A1+  Reaffirmed",
    "Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure -1.",
    "Rationale and key rating drivers",
    "The rating reaffirmation for the bank facilities of Vijay Sales (India) Private Limited (VSIPL) continues to derive strength",
    "from the experienced promoter group with a proven track record of more than four decades of operations in Indian",
    "consumer electroni c retail. The rating further derives strength from the continuous improvement in the financial risk",
    "profile , aided by robust growth in  cash flow from operating activities and the strong liquidity position as against  the",
    "negligible outside liabilities  of th e company . Majority of the debt comprises loans and advances from the promoter s",
    "that  are non -interest bearing and  continues to remain in the business over the last few fiscals. The overall gearing as",
    "on March 31, 2023,  stood at 2.30x  (including promoter loans and lease liability ), however, adjusted for the promoter",
    "loan s, the overall gearing stood at 0.57x.",
    "The rating further  considers the model of store ownership, with a total store count of 131 stores, of which 79 being",
    "self-owned while 52 being  rented  along with efficient inventory model and working capital management.  During FY23,",
    "(FY refers to the period from April 01 to March 31), VSIPL  reported a total operating income (TOI)  of ₹7,236 .02 crore",
    "as compared to ₹5,400 .55 crore in FY22, recording a year -on-year growth of around 3 4%. The profitability margins",
    "continued to remain stable at around 7-7.50 % during the last three fiscal s.",
    "Going forward , CARE Ratings expects  the growth momentum to continue on account of further expansion of new stores",
    "as well improving sales from the existing stores.  During FY22, the company had acquired 28 stores through slump  sale",
    "from Tirumala Music Centre , and with further addition of new stores, it plans to increase its presence in South India  as",
    "well.",
    "However, the rating  strengths  are tempered by the  presence of  large number of organised  and unorganised players",
    "dominating the market via online and offline mode. This apart , the sector continues to remain interest rate - and",
    "economic cycle -sensitive . Additionally, the business continues to be working capital -intensive, however, comfort is",
    "drawn from the fact that most of the working capital is met via  promoter loans and advances , a strong cash balance ,",
    "and an added cushion of ₹140 crore vis -à-vis working capital bank facilitie s, which largely remains unutilised .",
    "Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions",
    "Positive factors",
    "• Sustenance of the capital structure at the current levels with overall gearing (including guaranteed debt and",
    "• excluding unsecured loans from directors  or promoters) below 0.50x .",
    "• Profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation and taxation (PBILDT) margin of more than 8% on a",
    "sustained basis .",
    "Negative factors",
    "• Increase in operating cycle to over 50 days due to rise in inventory levels .",
    "• Increase in overall gearing above 1. 00x (excluding loans from directors  or promoters) on  a sustained basis.",
    "• Significant w ithdrawal of unsecured loans by promoters  or directors , leading to increased dependence on",
    "outside debt.",
    "Analytical approach:  Standalone",
    "Standalone approach after considering the support provided to  Amstrad Consumer India Private Limited (formerly",
    "known as  OVOT Private Limited ) in the form of a corporate guarantee  (CG)",

    "Detailed description of the key rating drivers:",
    "Key strengths",
    "Experienced promoter :",
    "VSIPL was initially being established by Nanu Gupta itself in 1971, who now has decades of experience in the",
    "electronic goods industry. Under his guidance, VSIPL grew as a successful multi brand electronic retail chain. The",
    "business , under the guidance of Nanu Gupta , is now  being supported  by his two sons, Nilesh Gupta and Ashish",
    "Gupta. Nanu Gupta is in charge of the finance department and sales of LCD  and LED televisions , Nilesh Gupta is",
    "in charge of sales of digital devices, human resource and marketing , while Ashish Gupta manages the sales of",
    "large appliances.",
    "Geographical coverage in Western and Northern India",
    "VSIPL current ly holds 131 stores across India, primarily in Mumbai , followed by Delhi and Guj arat. In  the recent",
    "past , its presence has evolved in the state of Telangana , mainly  post buying  28 stores from Tirumala Music Centre",
    "Pvt Ltd. The m ajority of the revenue of about 50% + is still being driven by Maharashtra itself.",
    "The company has an in -house brand called ‘Vise ’, which offers a wide range of televisions  and is exclusively",
    "available at V SIPL . Amstrad Consumer India Private Limited, formerly known as OVOT Private Limited  and Vijay",
    "Sales India Private Limited , is a common promoter holding of Nilesh Gupta and Ashish Gupta. This company sells",
    "products primarily  through V SIPL and is engaged in the trading and distribution of consumer durable products  and",
    "home appliances such as air conditioners, televisions, washing machines, irons, dryers, etc, which are exclusively",
    "available at VSIPL. In FY24, Amstrad Consumer India Private Limited commenced the in -house manufacturing of",
    "a few products, mainly washing machines  and air  conditioners . The Vise brand alone contributes about 25% of the",
    "total television volumes sold by VSIPL.",
    "Incremental size of business with stability in margins",
    "After the opening of  the economy post COVID , there had been an increased spending by consumer s primarily on",
    "digital electronics , driven by increased  reliance on digital gadgets, increased  consumer spending by way of readily",
    "available  cashless  financ ing options and cash back offers, growing population , and the rising desire towards",
    "improving the quality of life. The business was mainly driven by smartphones and laptops , contributing  to about",
    "35-40% of the total sales. However, a notable increase in volumes was  also  witnessed in washing machines , LED",
    "televisions, and air conditioners . The PBIL DT margin also remained stable at 7.24%  in FY23 (PY: 7.21%).",
    "Strong financial risk profile",
    "The financial risk profile of the company continues to improve on account of significant accretion of profit s to",
    "networth  as against negligible outside liabilities. Majority of the debt comprises of loans and advances from the",
    "promoters that are non -interest bearing and continues to remain in the business over the last few fiscals. The",
    "overall gearing as on March 31, 2023, stood at 2.30x  (including promoter loans and lease liability), however,",
    "adjusted for the promoter loans, the overall gearing stood at 0.57x . The financial risk profile is further aided by",
    "strong liquidity position with healthy cash and liquid investments of  ₹257.19 crore as on March 31, 2023.",
    "Key weaknesses",
    "Competition from organised as well as unorganised market",
    "The electronic retail sector is primarily dominated  by organi sed market participants, online retailers, and",
    "unorgani sed local shops. Authori sed distributors of electronic goods also counter  competition  to the existing",
    "consumer electronic retai l stores . Consequently, a competitive environment prevails throughout the industry. This",
    "situation ultimately results in customers having significant bargaining power, leaving retailers with minimal profit",
    "margins.",
    "Stock obsolescence risk",
    "Electronic products often have a short life -cycle due to rapid technological advancements  and change in",
    "preferences  and trends of the consumers . New and improved models are frequently introduced, leading to the",
    "3 CARE Ratings Ltd.",
    "Press Release",
    "obsolescence of older models.  Hence, it becomes necessary for the  electronic retail chains to maintain an optimum",
    "inventory level  and anticipating the demand via observing the  change in demand pattern , hence there is a constant",
    "urge to  stay on toes  to avoid backlogs and  minimise inventory risk at  the same time.",
    "Liquidity: Strong",
    "The liquidity position of the company remains strong , marked by healthy cash and liquid investments of ₹257.19",
    "crore  as on March 31, 2023. The  liquidity profile is further enhanced by fund -based working capital facilities of",
